; Section declaration: '.text' is where our executable code lives.
; Nasm also accepts ".section .text" but the dot before 'section' can be omitted as a common shorthand
.section .text

; This line tells the assembler that '_start' is the entry point of our program.
; It's like the "main" function in languages like C or Python.
global _start

; Although it's not necessary to specify the syntax, it's good practive as the GNU Assembler (GAS) assumes AT&T unless otherwise stated
.intel_syntax
; This is the label for the start of our program. The computer begins executing here.

    ; --- Step 1: Preparing to print "Hello, World!" ---
    ; In Linux, the system call for writing is number 4 (SYS_WRITE).
    ; We need to set up registers with specific values to tell the system what to do.

    mov eax, 4          ; A: [Prepare write]
                        ; Register EAX will hold the system call number 
                        ; Move the number 4 into the EAX register (4 for SYS_WRITE).
                        ; 'mov' means "move" or copy a value into a register.
                        ; EAX is a general-purpose register used for system call numbers.

    mov ebx, 1          ; B: [Define where to write]
                        ; Register EBX specifies where to write the data.
                        ; For printing to the console, we use file descriptor 1 (stdout).
                        ; Move the number 1 into EBX to indicate stdout.

    mov ecx, message    ; C: [Define where to find our message]
                        ; Register ECX holds the address of the string we want to print.
                        ; Our string "Hello, World!" is stored in the .data section (defined below).
                        ; We use the label 'message' to point to it.
                        ; Move the address of 'message' into ECX.
                        ; ECX now points to the start of our string in memory.

    mov edx, 14         ; D: [Define msg length]
                        ; Register EDX holds the length of the string to print.
                        ; Our string "Hello, World!\n" is 14 characters long (including the newline).
                        ; Move the number 14 into EDX to specify the string length.

    ; --- Step 2: Making the system call to print the string ---
    int 0x80            ; [Trigger system print]
                        ; Now that the registers are set up, we trigger the system call.
                        ; In x86 Linux, system calls are invoked using the 'int 0x80' instruction.
                        ; 'int' stands for interrupt, and 0x80 is the specific interrupt for Linux system calls.
                        ; Call the Linux kernel to execute the SYS_WRITE system call.
                        ; This will print "Hello, World!" followed by a newline to the console.

    ; --- Step 3: Exiting the program ---
    ; After printing, we need to tell the operating system that our program is done.
    ; We use the SYS_EXIT system call, which is number 1 in Linux.

    mov eax, 1          ; Prepare system for exit
                        ; Move the number 1 into EAX to indicate SYS_EXIT.
                        ; This tells the kernel we want to exit the program.

    mov ebx, 0          ; Move 0 into EBX to set the exit status.
                        ; An exit status of 0 means the program ended successfully.
                        ; Non-zero values usually indicate errors.

    int 0x80            ; Call the Linux kernel to execute the SYS_EXIT system call.
                        ; This terminates the program.
